##Unit 1 - Lesson 1


#Exercise 1. Probability of cyan - generalized
#In the edX exercises for this section, we calculated some probabilities by hand. Now we'll calculate those probabilities using R.
#One ball will be drawn at random from a box containing: 3 cyan balls, 5 magenta balls, and 7 yellow balls.
#What is the probability that the ball will be cyan?

cyan <- 3
magenta <- 5
yellow <- 7

#have a number variable for total
total <- cyan + magenta + yellow

# Assign a variable `p` as the probability of choosing a cyan ball from the box
p <- cyan / total

# Print the variable `p` to the console
p




#Exercise 2. Probability of not cyan - generalized
#We defined the variable p as the probability of choosing a cyan ball from a box containing: 3 cyan balls, 5 magenta balls, and 7 yellow balls.
#What is the probability that the ball you draw from the box will NOT be cyan?
# `p` is defined as the probability of choosing a cyan ball from a box containing: 3 cyan balls, 5 magenta balls, and 7 yellow balls.
# Using variable `p`, calculate the probability of choosing any ball that is not cyan from the box

#declare variables c for cyan, m for magenta, y for yellow, t for total
c <- 3
m <- 5
y <- 7
t <- c + m + y

p <- (t - c) / t
p 




#Exercise 3. Sampling without replacement - generalized
#Instead of taking just one draw, consider taking two draws. You take the second draw without returning the first draw to the box. 
#We call this sampling without replacement.
#What is the probability that the first draw is cyan and that the second draw is not cyan?

cyan <- 3
magenta <- 5
yellow <- 7

#declare a total variable
total <- cyan + magenta + yellow

# The variable `p_1` is the probability of choosing a cyan ball from the box on the first draw.
p_1 <- cyan / total

# Assign a variable `p_2` as the probability of not choosing a cyan ball on the second draw without replacement.

p_2 <- (magenta + yellow) / (total - 1)

# Calculate the probability that the first draw is cyan and the second draw is not cyan using `p_1` and `p_2`.
p <- p_1 * p_2

#print p
p




#Exercise 4. Sampling with replacement - generalized
#Now repeat the experiment, but this time, after taking the first draw and recording the color, return it back to the box 
#and shake the box. We call this sampling with replacement.
#What is the probability that the first draw is cyan and that the second draw is not cyan?

cyan <- 3
magenta <- 5
yellow <- 7

total <- cyan + magenta + yellow
# The variable 'p_1' is the probability of choosing a cyan ball from the box on the first draw.
p_1 <- cyan / total

# Assign a variable 'p_2' as the probability of not choosing a cyan ball on the second draw with replacement.
p_2 <- (total - cyan) / total

# Calculate the probability that the first draw is cyan and the second draw is not cyan using `p_1` and `p_2`.
p <- p_1 * p_2

p

##Unit 2 - Lesson 1


#Exercise 1. Independence
#Imagine you draw two balls from a box containing colored balls. You either replace the first ball before you draw the second 
#or you leave the first ball out of the box when you draw the second ball.
#Remember that two events A and B are independent if Pr(A and B) = Pr(A)Pr(B).
#    Q:  Under which situation are the two draws independent of one another?

#    A:  You do replace the first ball before drawing the next.




#Exercise 2. Sampling with replacement
#Say youâ€™ve drawn 5 balls from the a box that has 3 cyan balls, 5 magenta balls, and 7 yellow balls, with replacement, and all have been yellow.
#What is the probability that the next one is yellow?

cyan <- 3
magenta <- 5
yellow <- 7

total <- cyan + magenta + yellow
# Assign the variable 'p_yellow' as the probability that a yellow ball is drawn from the box.
p_yellow = (yellow / total)

# Using the variable 'p_yellow', calculate the probability of drawing a yellow ball on the sixth draw. Print this value to the console.
p_yellow
