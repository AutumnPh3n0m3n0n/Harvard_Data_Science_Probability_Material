#Question 1: Olympic running
#In the 200m dash finals in the Olympics, 8 runners compete for 3 medals (order matters). In the 2012 Olympics, 3 of the 8 runners were from Jamaica 
#and the other 5 were from different countries. The three medals were all won by Jamaica (Usain Bolt, Yohan Blake, and Warren Weir).
#Use the information above to help you answer the following four questions.

Question 1a: How many different ways can the 3 medals be distributed across 8 runners?
Answer: 336
Work: 8 * 7 * 6


Question 1b: How many different ways can the three medals be distributed among the 3 runners from Jamaica?
Answer: 6
Work: 3 * 1 * 1


Question 1c: What is the probability that all 3 medals are won by Jamaica?
Answer: 0.02
Work: 6 / 336


Task: Run a Monte Carlo simulation on this vector representing the countries of the 8 runners in this race:

runners <- c("Jamaica", "Jamaica", "Jamaica", "USA", "Ecuador", "Netherlands", "France", "South Africa")

#For each iteration of the Monte Carlo simulation, within a replicate() loop, select 3 runners representing the 3 medalists and check whether 
#they are all from Jamaica. Repeat this simulation 10,000 times. Set the seed to 1 before running the loop.

Question 1d: Calculate the probability that all the runners are from Jamaica.
Answer: 0.0184
Work:
> runners <- c("Jamaica", "Jamaica", "Jamaica", "USA", "Ecuador", "Netherlands", "France", "South Africa")
> second_runners <- c("Jamaica", "Jamaica", "USA", "Ecuador", "Netherlands", "France", "South Africa")
> third_runners <- c("Jamaica", "USA", "Ecuador", "Netherlands", "France", "South Africa")
> rounds <- 10000
> events <- replicate(rounds, sample(runners, 1))
> second_events <- replicate(rounds, sample(second_runners, 1))
> third_events <- replicate(rounds, sample(third_runners, 1))
> first_table <- table(events)
> second_table <- table(second_events)
> third_table <- table(third_events)
> prop.table(first_table)
> prop.table(second_table)
> prop.table(third_table)

#Examine the three tables, and look at the decimal number below Jamaica for each table. Multiply those numbers from the three tables together.




#Question 2: Restaurant management
#A restaurant manager wants to advertise that his lunch special offers enough choices to eat different meals every day of the year. He doesn't think 
#his current special actually allows that number of choices, but wants to change his special if needed to allow at least 365 choices.
#A meal at the restaurant includes 1 entree, 2 sides, and 1 drink. He currently offers a choice of 1 entree from a list of 6 options, a choice of 2 different 
#sides from a list of 6 options, and a choice of 1 drink from a list of 2 options.


Question 2a: How many meal combinations are possible with the current menu?
Answer: 180


Question 2b: How many combinations are possible if he expands his original special to 3 drink options?
Answer: 270


#The manager decides to add the third drink but needs to expand the number of options. The manager would prefer not to change his menu further and wants to 
#know if he can meet his goal by letting customers choose more sides.

Question 2c: How many meal combinations are there if customers can choose from 6 entrees, 3 drinks, and select 3 sides from the current 6 options?
Answer: 360


Task: Write a function that takes a number of entree choices and returns the number of meal combinations possible given that number of entree options, 3 drink 
--choices, and a selection of 2 sides from 6 options. Use the sapply() function to apply the function to entree option counts ranging from 1 to 12.

Question 2d: What is the minimum number of side options required in order to generate more than 365 combinations?
Answer: 9


Task: Write a function that takes a number of side choices and returns the number of meal combinations possible given 6 entree choices, 3 drink choices, and a 
--selection of 2 sides from the specified number of side choices.Use the sapply() function to apply the function to entree option counts ranging from 1 to 12.

Question 2e: What is the minimum number of side options required in order to generate more than 365 combinations?
Answer: 7




##Question 3:  Esophageal cancer and alcohol/tobacco use, part 1
#Case-control studies help determine whether certain exposures are associated with outcomes such as developing cancer. The built-in dataset esoph contains data 
#from a case-control study in France comparing people with esophageal cancer (cases, counted in ncases) to people without esophageal cancer (controls, counted in 
#ncontrols) that are carefully matched on a variety of demographic and medical characteristics. The study compares alcohol intake in grams per day (alcgp) and 
#tobacco intake in grams per day (tobgp) across cases and controls grouped by age range (agegp).


#The dataset is available in base R and can be called with the variable name esoph: 
head(esoph)

#You may wish to use the tidyverse package:
library(tidyverse)

#Each row contains one group of the experiment. Each group has a different combination of age, alcohol consumption, and tobacco consumption. The number of cancer 
#cases and number of controls (individuals without cancer) are reported for each group.


#Question 3a: How many groups are in the study?
Answer: 88
Solution: nrow(esoph)


#Question 3b: How many controls are there?
#Save this value as all_controls for later problems.
Answer: 200
Solution: 
all_controls <- sum(esoph$ncontrols)
all_controls


#Question 3c: How many controls are there?
#Save this value as all_controls for later problems.
Answer: 775
Solution:
all_cases <- sum(esoph$ncases)
all_cases


#Question 4

#Question 4a: What is the probability that a subject in the highest alcohol consumption group is a cancer case?
Answer: 0.672
Solution:
esoph %>%
  filter(alcgp == "120+") %>%
  summarize(ncases = sum(ncases), ncontrols = sum(ncontrols)) %>%
  mutate(p_case = ncases / (ncases + ncontrols)) %>%
  pull(p_case)


#Question 4b: What is the probability that a subject in the lowest alcohol consumption group is a cancer case?
#Round for three significantl digits, not the nearest thousandth
Answer: 0.0699
Solution:
esoph %>% filter(alcgp == "0-39g/day") %>%
  summarize(sum_cases=sum(ncases), tot=sum(ncontrols)+sum(ncases), probability=sum_cases/tot)


#Question 4c: Given that a person is a case, what is the probability that they smoke 10g or more a day?
Answer: 0.61
Solution:
tob_cases <- esoph %>%
  filter(tobgp != "0-9g/day") %>%
  pull(ncases) %>%
  sum()
tob_cases/all_cases

122 / 200 = 0.61


#Question 4d: Given that a person is a control, what is the probability that they smoke 10g or more a day?
Answer: 0.462
Solution:
tob_controls <- esoph %>%
  filter(tobgp != "0-9g/day") %>%
  pull(ncontrols) %>%
  sum()

tob_controls/all_controls

450 / 975 = 0.462
