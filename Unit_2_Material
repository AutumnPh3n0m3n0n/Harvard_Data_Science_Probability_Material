#Lesson 1: Question 1 - Distribution of female heights 
#Assume the distribution of female heights is approximated by a normal distribution with a mean of 64 inches and a standard deviation of 3 inches. If we pick 
#a female at random, what is the probability that she is 5 feet or shorter?

# Assign a variable 'female_avg' as the average female height.
female_avg <- 64

# Assign a variable 'female_sd' as the standard deviation for female heights.
female_sd <- 3

# Using variables 'female_avg' and 'female_sd', calculate the probability that a randomly selected female is shorter than 5 feet. Print this value to the console.

pnorm(60, female_avg, female_sd)




#Lesson 1: Question 2 - Distribution of female heights 
Assume the distribution of female heights is approximated by a normal distribution with a mean of 64 inches and a standard deviation of 3 inches. If we pick 
#a female at random, what is the probability that she is 6 feet or taller?


# Assign a variable 'female_avg' as the average female height.
female_avg <- 64

# Assign a variable 'female_sd' as the standard deviation for female heights.
female_sd <- 3

# Using variables 'female_avg' and 'female_sd', calculate the probability that a randomly selected female is 6 feet or taller. Print this value to the console.

1 - pnorm(72, female_avg, female_sd)




#Lesson 1: Question 3 - Distribution of female heights 
#Assume the distribution of female heights is approximated by a normal distribution with a mean of 64 inches and a standard deviation of 3 inches. If we pick a 
#female at random, what is the probability that she is between 61 and 67 inches?

# Assign a variable 'female_avg' as the average female height.
female_avg <- 64

# Assign a variable 'female_sd' as the standard deviation for female heights.
female_sd <- 3

# Using variables 'female_avg' and 'female_sd', calculate the probability that a randomly selected female is between the desired height range. Print this value to the console.

#Use pnorm to define the probability that a randomly chosen woman will be shorter than 67 inches.
female_upper_bound <- pnorm(67, female_avg, female_sd)
female_upper_bound
#Subtract the probability that a randomly chosen will be shorter than 61 inches.
female_lower_bound <- female_upper_bound - pnorm(61, female_avg, female_sd)
